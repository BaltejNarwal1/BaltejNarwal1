   <h2>Kobe's Oscar</h2>
   </font>
   <p>Joining Frances McDormand, Jordan Peele and Gary Oldman in accepting Academy Awards on Sunday night was someone more readily associated with other kinds of honors: Kobe Bryant.

Bryant, who retired from the N.B.A. in 2016, was involved in turning a poem he wrote into a film, “Dear Basketball,” that won the prize for best animated short.

The film depicts Bryant as a child dreaming of basketball glory and as an N.B.A. star. Bryant said the film was “about the emotional journey of having a dream, believing it’ll come true; it comes true, then the realization that you have to wake up from that dream and move on to another.”

Bryant surrounded himself with first-rate teammates in creating the film, including John Williams, the five-time Oscar winning composer, and Glen Keane, a former Disney animator.</p>
