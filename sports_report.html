   <h2>Kobe's Oscar</h2>
   <p>Joining Frances McDormand, Jordan Peele and Gary Oldman in accepting Academy Awards on Sunday night was someone more readily associated with other kinds of honors: Kobe Bryant.

Bryant, who retired from the N.B.A. in 2016, was involved in turning a poem he wrote into a film, “Dear Basketball,” that won the prize for best animated short.

The film depicts Bryant as a child dreaming of basketball glory and as an N.B.A. star. Bryant said the film was “about the emotional journey of having a dream, believing it’ll come true; it comes true, then the realization that you have to wake up from that dream and move on to another.”

Bryant surrounded himself with first-rate teammates in creating the film, including John Williams, the five-time Oscar winning composer, and Glen Keane, a former Disney animator.</p>

    <h2>Miralem Pjanic is the next Pirlo</h2>
    <p>“Mire’s ability is to hit them in different ways, with curve, with power and effect,” Juninho told La Gazzetta dello Sport last year. “The trajectories are unpredictable, when the ball comes off his foot it often changes direction and that makes it difficult for the goalkeeper. Given how young he is, he’s already among the best in that speciality.” High praise indeed, but according to Opta, no player – including Pirlo – has scored more free kicks (14) in Serie A than Pjanić in the last ten years, a remarkable feat given he didn’t arrive in Italy until August 2011.

Fans of the Old Lady have certainly noted his impact, seemingly dubbing him with a nickname that follows in the footsteps of the “Mozart” or “Maestro” monikers once bestowed upon Pirlo. Labelled "The Pianist” by Juventus supporters on the Curva Sud, they will hope Tottenham are dancing to Miralem Pjanić’s tune over the course of Wednesday evening’s second leg.</p>
